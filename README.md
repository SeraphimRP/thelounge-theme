# thelounge-theme-seraphimrp

A personal theme, derived from [thelounge-theme-nord](https://github.com/seraphimrp/thelounge-theme-nord).

## What's different?

So far, it's just font changes. The changes to this theme will only be for things that I like but don't think people would want out of the nord theme. It is possible that certain changes made in here might make its way upstream.

## Install

`thelounge install thelounge-theme-seraphimrp`
